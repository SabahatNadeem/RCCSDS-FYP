We as the Students of Software Engineering Department are aimed to work on the current global problem of pandemic which is highly concerned at this time which is basically maintaining the SOPs among the individuals. The idea of our internal advisor and our personal motivation to solve this problem compelled us to work on this project. The application which is to be developed will help the government and the concerned authorities to take immediate action against the individuals not following the SOPS as our system will immediately notify them in real time.

Social distancing has been proven as an effective measure against the spread of the infectious Coronavirus Disease. However, individuals are not used to tracking the required 3 feet distance between themselves and their surroundings, also businesses have to comply with restrictions on the number of visitors based on the new government social distancing regulations. Having to control the number of visitors poses a problem for essential public service providers. To ensure that people are as spaced out as needed requires an active surveillance system capable of detecting distances and total number of individuals in a particular place.
